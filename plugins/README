 A short guide to plugins for pyjama
+-----------------------------------+

Pyjama uses a new plugin system since version 0.1.29.
This is a short guide how to do plugins for pyjama now.

 Requirements
+------------+
    1) plugins have to be stored in pyjama's plugin folder
    2) every plugin has its own folder there
    3) each plugin needs a .info file in its folder
    4) each plugin needs a file called "__init__.py" in its folder

 .info file
+----------+
    1) this file has to have the same name as its folder
    2) it holds:
        - "name" to store the plugin's full name
        - "version" to store the plugin's current version
        - "order" to influence in which order the plugins are loaded
          the higher this value is the later pyjama will load the plugin
        - "author" to store the author's name
        - "description" for a short description of the plugin
        - "copyright" for a short copyright line
        - "license" the plugin's license
    	- "homepage" 

    A proper .info file might look like this:

    Name = Example Plugin 123
    Order = 500
    Version = 0.17
    Author = Me
    Description = Just testing
    Copyright = By me 2009-FFFFFF
    License = GPLv3
    homepage = http://www.xn--ngel-5qa.de

 __init__.py
+-----------+
    * this file is needed to treat the while directory as a module
    * it needs to have a class called "main"
    * pyjama will pass a object holding all pyjama objects to this class 

 Example
+-------+
    the directory scheme should be something like this:

    pyjama/
        plugins/
            my_plugin/
                __init__.py
                my_plugin.info
            anotherplugin/
                __init__.py
                anotherplugin.info

!! Please have a look at pyjama's example plugin - it is quite simple !!
