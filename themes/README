This folder is preserved for the standard-theme, which
is delivered with pyjama. It is going to be copied to
/usr/share/apps/pyjama during installation. Copying
other themes - which are not set to be standard-theme
in constants.py - will have NO EFFECT.
Themes you want to install HAVE to be placed into the
folder
 ~/.pyjama/themes.
